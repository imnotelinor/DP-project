**What I’ve worked on:**  
- Read through the project brief and clarified the main and smaller research questions.
- Planned the visualization structure: interactive bubble chart using Bokeh.
- Set up GitHub repository and project folder structure.

**What problems I encountered:**  
- None yet, but unsure how to structure the dataset for year-based filtering in Bokeh.

**What I learned:**  
- Bokeh is a powerful interactive visualization tool in Python.
- Reviewed past examples of Gapminder-style visualizations.

**Resources I used:**  
- [Bokeh Documentation - First Steps](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps.html)  
- [Gapminder dataset source](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
- [DP project assignment brief](https://sp.proglab.nl/project/development)

What I’ve worked on:
Wrote and finalized the research question, hypothesis, and motivation for the project. Reviewed data structure of the Gapminder dataset to identify how fertility and life expectancy variables are organized by country and year.

What problems I encountered:
Still unsure about the best way to structure the dataset in Bokeh for smooth year-based filtering and animation. Need to experiment with ColumnDataSource and slider callbacks.

What I learned:
Clarifying the research question and motivation helps narrow the project focus. Also learned more about the logic behind demographic transition and its link to data visualization.
Resources I used:
- [The global decline of the fertility rate](https://ourworldindata.org/global-decline-fertility-rate)
- [Gapminder dataset source](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
